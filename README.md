## 🧭 Purpose

**PMO\_Local-Folder-Structure** is a plug-and-play folder architecture designed to serve as the *Digital Backbone* of a Project Manager’s local environment.
It’s a replicable, adaptable, and clean hierarchy that gives every PM or PMO team the *white rabbit* to follow from initiation to closure — minus the chaos of hunting for lost Excel files or tribal knowledge in outdated PDFs.

Whether you’re managing CAPM exam prep or enterprise deployments, this structure keeps your deliverables, templates, and documentation clear, centralized, and **battle-ready**.

---

## 🧱 Features

* ✅ **Modular folder structure**: Pre-built directories for every phase of the project lifecycle
* ✅ **Template-ready**: Drop-in templates for RACI charts, Stakeholder Maps, Risk Registers, and more
* ✅ **PMO scalability**: Suitable for single projects or multi-program offices
* ✅ **Offline & GitHub sync-friendly**: Can be used locally or mirrored on Git for version control
* ✅ **Contextual clarity**: Every folder has a purpose — every file a home

*And yes — it’s recursive, expandable, and resistant to project entropy.* 🌀

## 🛸 Inspired by Neo's PM Mind Palace

This project is part of the **Andrew Matrix**, where structured chaos meets project excellence — a place where folders don’t get lost, and templates aren’t ghost stories whispered in dark hallways.
